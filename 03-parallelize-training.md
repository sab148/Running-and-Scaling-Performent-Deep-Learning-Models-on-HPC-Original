## Before Starting

- If you have not done it already, clone the following repo:

    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sab148/Running-and-Scaling-Performent-Deep-Learning-Models-on-HPC.git
    ```

---

## What this code does 

- It trains a [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762) language model on [WikiText-2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mindchain/wikitext2) dataset to predict the next word in a sequence. 
- **Transformers** is a deep learning model architecture that uses self-attention to process sequences in parallel.
- **WikiText-2** is a word-level language modeling dataset consisting of over 2 million tokens extracted from high-quality Wikipedia articles. 

---

## What this code does 

- Again, this is not a deep learning course.
- If you are not familiar with the model and the dataset, just imagine it as a black box: you provide it with text, and it generates another text.

    ![](images/black_box.svg)

---

## Libraries

- You already downloaded the libraries yesterday that we will use today:
    - **PyTorch:** A deep learning framework for building and training models.
    - **datasets** A library from Hugging Face used to access, load, process, and share large datasets.
    
---

Let's have a look at the files **```train/single_gpu_training.py```** and **```single_gpu_training.sbatch```** in the repo.

![](images/look.jpg)

---

## Run the Training Script

- There are TODOs in these two files. **Do not modify the TODOs for now**. The code is already working, so you don’t need to make any changes at this point.
- Now run:

    ```bash
    sbatch single_gpu_training.sbatch
    ```

- Spoiler alert 🚨

- The code won't work.

- Check the output and error files

---

## What is the problem?

- Remember, there is no internet on the compute node.
- Therefore, you should:
    - **Comment out** lines 77 **to** 152.
    - Activate your environment:

        ```bash
        source ./sc_venv_template_HPC_supporter_course/activate.sh
        ```

    - Run:

        ```bash
        python train/single_gpu_training.py
        ```

    - **Uncomment back** lines 77-152.
    - Finally, run your job again 🚀:

        ```bash
        sbatch single_gpu_training.sbatch
        ```

---

## JOB Running

- Congrats, you are training a DL model on the supercomputer using one GPU 🎉

--- 

## llview

- You can monitor your training using [llview](https://go.fzj.de/llview-jureca). 
- Use your Judoor credentials to connect.
- Check the job number that you are intrested in.
    ![](images/llview_job.png){height=400px}

---


## llview

- Go to the right to open the PDF document. **It may take some time to load the job information, so please wait until the icon turns blue**.
    ![](images/llview.png){height=450px}

---

## llview

- You have many information about your job once you open the PDF file.
    ![](images/llview_info.png)

---

## GPU utilization 

- You can see that in fact we are using **1 GPU**

    ![](images/llview_gpu_1.png)

---

## GPU utilization   

- It is a waste of resources.

- The training takes time (1h32m according to llview).

- Then, can we run our model on multiple GPUs ?

---

## What if

- At line 3 in file **```single_gpu_training.sbatch```**, we increase the number of GPUs to 4:

    ```bash
    #SBATCH --gres=gpu:4
    ```

- And run our job again

    ```bash
    sbatch single_gpu_training.sbatch
    ```

--- 


## llview

- We are still using **1 GPU**

![](images/llview_gpu_2.png)

---

## We need communication

- Without correct setup, the GPUs might not be utilized.

- Furthermore, we don't have an established communication between the GPUs

---

## We need communication

![](images/dist/comm2.svg){height=500px}

---

## collective operations

- The GPUs use collective operations to communicate and share data in parallel computing
- The most common collective operations are: All Reduce, All Gather, and Reduce Scatter

---

## All Reduce 

![](images/dist/all_reduce.svg)

- Other operations, such as **min**, **max**, and **avg**, can also be performed using All-Reduce.

---

## All Gather

![](images/dist/all_gather.svg)

--- 

## Reduce Scatter

![](images/dist/reduce_scatter.svg)

--- 

## Terminologies

- Before going further, we need to learn some terminologies

---

## World Size

![](images/dist/gpus.svg){height=550px}

---

## Rank

![](images/dist/rank.svg){height=550px}

---

## local_rank

![](images/dist/local_rank.svg){height=550px}

---

## Now

That we have understood how the devices communicate and the terminologies used in parallel computing, 
we can move on to distributed training (training on multiple GPUs).

---

## Distributed Training

- Parallelize the training across multiple nodes, 
- Significantly enhancing training speed and model accuracy.
- It is particularly beneficial for large models and computationally intensive tasks, such as deep learning.[[1]](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/distributed/home.html)


---

## Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)

[DDP](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html) is a method in parallel computing used to train deep learning models across multiple GPUs or nodes efficiently.

## DDP

If you're scaling DDP to use multiple nodes, the underlying principle remains the same as single-node multi-GPU training.

---

## DDP

![](images/ddp/multi_node.svg){height=500px}

---

## DDP recap

- Each GPU on each node gets its own process.
- Each GPU has a copy of the model.
- Each GPU has visibility into a subset of the overall dataset and will only see that subset.
- Each process performs a full forward and backward pass in parallel and calculates its gradients.
- The gradients are synchronized and averaged across all processes.
- Each process updates its optimizer.

---

## Let's start coding!

- Whenever you see **TODOs**💻📝, follow the instructions to either copy-paste the code at the specified line numbers or type it yourself.

- Depending on how you copy and paste, the line numbers may vary, but always refer to the TODO numbers in the code and slides.

---

## Setup communication

- We need to setup a communication among the GPUs. 
- For that we would need the file **```distributed_utils.py```**.
- **TODOs**💻📝:
    1. Import **```distributed_utils```** file at line 11:
        
        ```python 
        # This file contains utility_functions for distributed training.
        from utils.distributed_utils import *
        ```
    2. Then **remove** lines 67 and 68:

        ```python
        ## TODO 2-3: Remove this line and replace it with a call to the utility function setup().
        device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
        ```
    3. and **add** at line 67 a call to the method **```setup()```** defined in **```distributed_utils.py```**: 

        ```python
        # Initialize a communication group and return the right identifiers.
        local_rank, rank, device, world_size = setup()
        ```

---

## Setup communication

What is in the **```setup()```** method ?

```python
def setup():
    # Initializes a communication group using 'nccl' as the backend for GPU communication.
    torch.distributed.init_process_group(backend='nccl')
    # Get the identifier of each process within a node
    local_rank = int(os.getenv('LOCAL_RANK'))
    # Get the global identifier of each process within the distributed system
    rank = int(os.environ['RANK'])
    # Creates a torch.device object that represents the GPU to be used by this process.
    device = torch.device('cuda', local_rank)
    # Sets the default CUDA device for the current process, 
    # ensuring all subsequent CUDA operations are performed on the specified GPU device.
    torch.cuda.set_device(device)
    # Different random seed for each process.
    torch.random.manual_seed(1000 + torch.distributed.get_rank())

    return local_rank, rank, device
```

---

## DistributedSampler 

- **TODO 4**💻📝:

    - At line 78, instantiate a **DistributedSampler** object for each set to ensure that each process gets a different subset of the data.
    
        ```python
        # DistributedSampler object for each set to ensure that each process gets a different subset of the data.
        train_sampler = torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler(train_dataset, 
                                                                        shuffle=True, 
                                                                        seed=args.seed)
        val_sampler = torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler(val_dataset)
        test_sampler = torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler(test_dataset)
        ```

---

## DataLoader

- **TODO 5**💻📝:

    - At line 87, **REMOVE** **```shuffle=True```** in the DataLoader of train_loader and **REPLACE** it by **```sampler=train_sampler```**
        
        ```python 
        train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, 
                                batch_size=args.batch_size, 
                                sampler=train_sampler, # pass the sampler argument to the DataLoader
                                num_workers=int(os.getenv('SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK')),
                                pin_memory=True)
        ```

---

## DataLoader

- **TODO 6**💻📝:

    -  At line 92, pass **val_sampler** to the sampler argument of the val_dataLoader

        ```python
        val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset,
                                batch_size=args.batch_size,
                                sampler=val_sampler, # pass the sampler argument to the DataLoader
                                pin_memory=True)
        ```

- **TODO 7**💻📝:

    - At line 96, pass **test_sampler** to the sampler argument of the test_dataLoader

        ```python
        test_loader = DataLoader(test_dataset,
                                batch_size=args.test_batch_size,
                                sampler=test_sampler, # pass the sampler argument to the DataLoader
                                pin_memory=True)    
        ```

--- 

## Model

- **TODO 8**💻📝:

    - At line 112, wrap the model in a **DistributedDataParallel** (DDP) module to parallelize the training across multiple GPUs.
    
        ```python 
        # Wrap the model in DistributedDataParallel module 
        model = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(
            model,
            device_ids=[local_rank],
        )
        ```

---

## Sampler 

- **TODO 9**💻📝:

    - At line 129, **set** the current epoch for the dataset sampler to ensure proper data shuffling in each epoch

        ```python
        # Pass the current epoch to the sampler to ensure proper data shuffling in each epoch
        train_sampler.set_epoch(epoch)
        ```

---

## All Reduce Operation

- **TODO 10**💻📝:

    - At **lines 38 and 60**, Obtain the global average loss across the GPUs.

        ```python
        # Return the global average loss.
        torch.distributed.all_reduce(result, torch.distributed.ReduceOp.AVG)
        ```

---

## print

- **TODO 11**💻📝:

    - **Replace** all the ```print``` methods by **```print0```** method defined in **```distributed_utils.py```** to allow only rank 0 to print in the output file.
    
    - At **line 135** 

        ```python
        # We use the utility function print0 to print messages only from rank 0.
        print0(f'[{epoch+1}/{args.epochs}] Train loss: {train_loss:.5f}, validation loss: {val_loss:.5f}')
        ```

    - At **line 150**
    
        ```python
        # We use the utility function print0 to print messages only from rank 0.
        print0('Final test loss:', test_loss.item())
        ```

---

## print

The definition of the function **print0** is in **```distributed_utils.py```**

```python
functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def is_root_process():
    """Return whether this process is the root process."""
    return torch.distributed.get_rank() == 0


def print0(*args, **kwargs):
    """Print something only on the root process."""
    if is_root_process():
        print(*args, **kwargs)
```

---

## Save model 

- **TODO 12**💻📝:

    - At **lines 145 and 154**, replace torch.save method with the utility function save0 to allow only the process with rank 0 to save the model.
 
        ```python 
        # We allow only rank=0 to save the model
        save0(model, 'model-best.pt')
        ```
        ```python 
        # We allow only rank=0 to save the model
        save0(model, 'model-final.pt')
        ```

---

## Save model 

The method **save0** is defined in **```distributed_utils.py```**

```python
functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def is_root_process():
    """Return whether this process is the root process."""
    return torch.distributed.get_rank() == 0


def save0(*args, **kwargs):
    """Pass the given arguments to `torch.save`, but only on the root
    process.
    """
    # We do *not* want to write to the same location with multiple
    # processes at the same time.
    if is_root_process():
        torch.save(*args, **kwargs)
```

--- 

## Destroy Process Group

- **TODO 13**💻📝:

    - At **line 160**, destroy every process group and backend by calling destroy_process_group() 

        ```python 
        # Destroy the process group to clean up resources
        destroy_process_group()
        ```

---

## Destroy Process Group

The method **destroy_process_group** is defined in **```distributed_utils.py```**

```python
def destroy_process_group():
    """Destroy the process group."""
    if torch.distributed.is_initialized():
        torch.distributed.destroy_process_group()
```

---

## We are almost there

- That's it for the **train/single_gpu_training.py** file. 
- But before launching our job, we need to add some lines to **single_gpu_training.sbatch** file 

---

## Setup communication

In **```single_gpu_training.sbatch```** file:

- **TODOs 14**💻📝: 
    - At line 3, increase the number of GPUs to 4 if it is not already done.

        ```bash
        #SBATCH --gres=gpu:4
        ```

    - At line 21, pass the correct number of devices.

        ```bash
        # Set up four visible GPUs that the job can use 
        export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3
        ```

---

## Setup communication

Stay in **```single_gpu_training.sbatch```** file:

- **TODO 15**💻📝: we need to setup **MASTER_ADDR** and **MASTER_PORT** to allow communication over the system.

    - At line 24, add the following:

        ```bash
        # Extracts the first hostname from the list of allocated nodes to use as the master address.
        MASTER_ADDR="$(scontrol show hostnames "$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST" | head -n 1)"
        # Modifies the master address to allow communication over InfiniBand cells.
        MASTER_ADDR="${MASTER_ADDR}i"
        # Get IP for hostname.
        export MASTER_ADDR="$(nslookup "$MASTER_ADDR" | grep -oP '(?<=Address: ).*')"
        export MASTER_PORT=7010
        ```

---

## Setup communication

We are not done yet with **```single_gpu_training.sbatch```** file:

- **TODO 16**💻📝: 
    
    - We **remove** the lauching script at line 45:
    
        ```bash
        srun --cpu_bind=none python train/single_gpu_training.py 
        ```
    
    - We use **torchrun** instead to launch our training and pass the following argument: 

        ```bash
        # Launch a distributed training job across multiple nodes and GPUs
        srun --cpu_bind=none bash -c "torchrun \
            --nnodes=$SLURM_NNODES \
            --rdzv_backend c10d \
            --nproc_per_node=gpu \
            --rdzv_id $RANDOM \
            --rdzv_endpoint=$MASTER_ADDR:$MASTER_PORT \
            --rdzv_conf=is_host=\$(if ((SLURM_NODEID)); then echo 0; else echo 1; fi) \
            train/single_gpu_training.py "
        ```

---

## Setup communication

- The arguments that we pass are:

    1. **```nnodes=$SLURM_NNODES```**: the number of nodes
    2. **```rdzv_backend c10d```**: the c10d method for coordinating the setup of communication among distributed processes.
    3. **```nproc_per_node=gpu```** the number of GPUs
    4. **```rdzv_id $RANDOM```** a random id which that acts as a central point for initializing and coordinating the communication among different nodes participating in the distributed training. 
    5. **```rdzv_endpoint=$MASTER_ADDR:$MASTER_PORT```** the IP that we setup in the previous slide to ensure all nodes know where to connect to start the training session.
    6. **```rdzv_conf=is_host=\$(if ((SLURM_NODEID)); then echo 0; else echo 1; fi)```** The rendezvous host which is responsible for coordinating the initial setup of communication among the nodes.

---

## done ✅

- You can finally run:

    ```bash
    sbatch single_gpu_training.sbatch
    ```

---

## llview

- Let's have a look at our job using [llview](https://go.fzj.de/llview-jureca) again.

- You can see that now, we are using all the GPUs of the node

- ![](images/llview_gpu_4.png)

--- 

## llview

- And that our job took less time to finish training (25m vs 1h32m with one GPU)

- But what about using more nodes ?

---

## What about using more nodes ?

---

## Multi-node training

- **TODO 17**💻📝: in **```single_gpu_training.sbatch```** at line 2, you can increase the number of nodes to 2:

    ```bash
    #SBATCH --nodes=2
    ```

- Hence, you will use 8 GPUs for training.

- Run again:

    ```bash
    sbatch single_gpu_training.sbatch
    ```

--- 

## llview

- Open [llview](https://go.fzj.de/llview-jureca) again.

- You can see that now, we are using 2 nodes and 8 GPUs.

- ![](images/llview_gpu_8.png)

- And the training took less time (14m)

---

## Amazing ✨

---

## DDP with PYTORCH LIGHTNING (PL)

To use DDP with PL, we need to make some changes to the model code and the sbatch file, and create a new main file. You can find all these changes in:

- `model/transformerLM.py`
- `train/Lit_training.py`
- `Lit_training.sbatch`

---

## Before we go further...

- Distributed Data parallel is usually good enough 👌 
- However, if your model is too big to fit into a single GPU
- Welllll ... there are other distributed techniques ...

- **TODO 17**💻📝: **Delete** lines 111–116 that wrap the model in DistributedDataParallel, and instead wrap the model using torch.distributed.fsdp.

    ```python
    # Unlike DDP, we should apply fully_shard to both submodules and the root model.
    # Here, we apply fully_shard to each TransformerEncoder and TransformerDecoder block,
    # and then to the root model.
    fsdp_kwargs = {}
    for module in model.modules():
        if isinstance(module, (
                torch.nn.TransformerEncoder, 
                torch.nn.TransformerDecoder,)
            ):
            # Each TransformerEncoder and TransformerDecoder block is treated as a separate FSDP unit.
            torch.distributed.fsdp.fully_shard(module, **fsdp_kwargs)

    # Identifies all parameters not already wrapped and groups them into a shardable unit.
    torch.distributed.fsdp.fully_shard(model, **fsdp_kwargs)
    ```

## Save Model state

- **TODO 18**💻📝: 
    - **Remove** lines 153 to 155 and **replace** them with:
        
        ```python
        # Save sharded model and optimizer
        save_sharded_model(model, optimizer, 'model_best')
        ```

    - **Remove** lines 161 to 163 and **replace** them with:
        
        ```python    
        # Save sharded model and optimizer
        save_sharded_model(model, optimizer, 'model_final')
        ```

---

## How the model is saved

- We can either save the full model state, as we did with DDP, or save the sharded model state. We can also choose to save the optimizer state.

- The relevant methods can be found in the **distributed_utils.py** file.

- To save the sharded model, we use **DCP**.

---

## What is DCP

- Distributed Checkpoint (DCP) support loading and saving models from multiple ranks in parallel. It supports load-time resharding, which means a model can be saved using one cluster configuration (e.g., number of GPUs or nodes) and later loaded using a different configuration, without requiring the checkpoint to be rewritten.

- DCP is different than torch.save and torch.load in a few significant ways:

    1. It produces multiple files per checkpoint, with at least one per rank.
    2. It operates in place, meaning that the model should allocate its data first and DCP uses that storage instead.

---

## Save full model state

- We use **get_model_state_dict** method with **full_state_dict=True** and **cpu_offload=True** to all-gathers tensors and offload them to CPU. No ShardedTensor will be in the returned state_dict. 

    ```python
    def save_full_model(model, optimizer=None, *args, **kwargs):
        """Stream all model parameters to rank 0 on the CPU, then pass all
        other given arguments to `torch.save` to save the model, but only on
        the root process.
        """
        state_dict_options = dist_state_dict.StateDictOptions(
            full_state_dict=True,
            cpu_offload=True,
        )
        cpu_state_dict = dist_state_dict.get_model_state_dict(
            model,
            options=state_dict_options,
        )
        cpu_state = {'model': cpu_state_dict}
        if optimizer is not None:
            optim_state_dict = dist_state_dict.get_optimizer_state_dict(
                model,
                optimizer,
                options=state_dict_options,
            )
            cpu_state['optimizer'] = optim_state_dict
        save0(cpu_state, *args, **kwargs)
    ```

---

## Save sharded model 

```python
class AppState(Stateful):
    def __init__(self, model, optimizer=None):
        self.model = model
        self.optimizer = optimizer

    def state_dict(self):
        # Automatically manages FSDP, as well as sets the default state dict type to FSDP.SHARDED_STATE_DICT
        model_state_dict, optimizer_state_dict = get_state_dict(self.model, self.optimizer)
        return {
            "model": model_state_dict,
            "optim": optimizer_state_dict
        }
        
    def load_state_dict(self, state_dict):
        # Sets our state dicts on the model and optimizer, now that we've loaded
        set_state_dict(
            self.model,
            self.optimizer,
            model_state_dict=state_dict["model"],
            optim_state_dict=state_dict["optim"]
        )

def save_sharded_model(model, optimizer=None, CHECKPOINT_DIR='checkpoints'):
    state_dict = { "app": AppState(model, optimizer) }
    dcp.save(state_dict, checkpoint_id=CHECKPOINT_DIR)
```

## Run your training

- You can run the same sbatch file without any modification.

    ```bash
    sbatch fsdp_training.sbatch
    ```

## llview

- Let's have a look at llview again:

## sharding_strategy

- **FULL_SHARD**: Parameters, gradients, and optimizer states are sharded. Set **reshard_after_forward=True**
- **SHARD_GRAD_OP**: Similar to PyTorch’s DistributedDataParallel API. Set **reshard_after_forward=False**
- **HYBRID_SHARD**: Apply FULL_SHARD within a node, and replicate parameters across nodes. Set **reshard_after_forward=True** with a 2D device mesh
- **_HYBRID_SHARD_ZERO2**: Apply SHARD_GRAD_OP within a node, and replicate parameters across nodes. This is like HYBRID_SHARD, except this may provide even higher throughput since the unsharded parameters are not freed after the forward pass, saving the all-gathers in the pre-backward. Set **reshard_after_forward=False** with a 2D device mesh -->

## FSDP

- FSDP is a built-in primitive in PyTorch for distributed training.
- It is highly memory efficient because it shards model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across GPUs.
- This allows training of very large models (often >1B parameters) that wouldn’t fit in memory otherwise.
- However, FSDP relies on frequent communication between GPUs, so it requires a high-bandwidth interconnect (e.g., InfiniBand).
- On bandwidth-limited clusters, FSDP may become a bottleneck, and pipeline parallelism might be preferable.

---

## That's it for FSDP, now let's move to another parallelization technique.

---

## Model Parallel

- Before talking about pipelining, let's talk about Model Parallelism (MP).
- Model *itself* is too big to fit in one single GPU 🐋
- Each GPU holds a slice of the model 🍕
- Data moves from one GPU to the next

## This is an oversimplification!

- Actually, you split the input minibatch into multiple microbatches.
- There's still idle time - an unavoidable "bubble" 🫧

## Model Parallel - Multi Node

- In this case, each node does the same as the others. 
- At each step, they all synchronize their weights.

## Pipeline Parallelism

- Pipeline parallelism does not require frequent communication because the model is stored sequentially in stages.
- If your model is computationally intensive with extremely wide layers, you may consider Tensor Parallelism (TP).

## TP 

- We have introduced row parallelism.
- There is also column parallelism, where the weight columns are split across GPUs.
- Tensor Parallelism (TP) is great for large, compute-heavy layers like matrix multiplications.
- However, TP requires frequent communication during tensor operations.

## 3D Parallelism

![[3D Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06511)](images/3dp.png)

- 3D Parallelism combines Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), and Data Parallelism (DP) to efficiently train large models by distributing computation, memory, and data across multiple GPUs. 
- It enables scaling to very large models by addressing compute, memory, and communication bottlenecks in a balanced way.
